Certainly, David! Let's address your questions:

### Parallelizing Frame Extraction
You can parallelize the frame extraction process to improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of videos. Python's `concurrent.futures` library is well-suited for this task.

#### Sample Code for Parallel Frame Extraction:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def process_video(video_path):
    frames = extract_frames(video_path)
    # Further processing, e.g., classification
    return frames

video_paths = [...] # List of video paths

with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_video, video_paths))
```

### Optimizing Performance with OpenAI for Image Classification
Using OpenAI for image classification will require sending the frames to OpenAI's servers. Here are some considerations:

- **Batching**: If possible, send multiple frames in a single request to reduce overhead.
- **Compression**: Consider compressing the images before sending them to save bandwidth.
- **Concurrent Requests**: If you're sending requests to OpenAI for each video or frame, consider parallelizing these requests as well.

### Handling Frame Data
Since you'll be sending the frames to OpenAI, you have options on how to handle the frame data:

- **In-Memory**: You can keep the frames in memory (as NumPy arrays or similar) and send them directly to OpenAI. This avoids the need to write the frames to disk, which can be more efficient.
- **Temporary Files**: If you need to preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, converting formats), you might save them to temporary files. Use Python's `tempfile` library to manage these.

### Caching Considerations
If you're repeatedly processing the same videos, caching the extracted frames can save time. Options include:

- **In-Memory Caching**: If you have enough RAM, you can cache the frames in memory using a structure like a dictionary.
- **Disk Caching**: For longer-term or larger-scale caching, consider a disk-based cache. Libraries like `joblib` can simplify this.

### Summary
Parallelizing the frame extraction and optimizing the communication with OpenAI can significantly improve performance. Handling the frames in memory (rather than saving them) can also enhance efficiency, especially if you're processing the frames immediately with OpenAI.

Integrating all these pieces will create a robust and efficient pipeline for extracting frames from videos, classifying them with OpenAI, and handling the results.
