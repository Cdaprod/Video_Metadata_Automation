Certainly, David! Let's break down the structure and workflow based on the three Jupyter notebooks you mentioned, along with the corresponding tasks and storage locations.

### Directory Tree Structure:

```plaintext
project_root/
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── VideoDatabasing.ipynb
│   ├── FrameExtraction.ipynb
│   ├── GenerateMetadata.ipynb
│
├── data/ # Tracked data directory for tables and final outputs
│
├── temp/ # Untracked temporary storage for frames and intermediate data
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/ # GitHub Actions workflows
│
└── README.md
```

### Workflow Overview:

#### 1. **VideoDatabasing.ipynb**:
   - **Tasks**: Handles generating tables, scanning videos, and creating indexing information.
   - **Outputs**: Saves DataFrame to `/data/` directory for tracked data.
   - **Integration**: GitHub Actions can update the Postgres database based on the data in `/data/`.

#### 2. **FrameExtraction.ipynb**:
   - **Tasks**: Handles extracting frames from videos and processing them.
   - **Temporary Storage**: Uses `/temp/` directory for untracked storage of frames.
   - **Outputs**: Final output (e.g., classifications, metadata) saved to `/data/` directory for tracked data.
   - **Integration**: Data in `/data/` can be pushed to Postgres or used in further processing.

#### 3. **GenerateMetadata.ipynb**:
   - **Tasks**: Takes Postgres tables and generates a new table for Black Box Global Metadata.
   - **Outputs**: Records to the `/data/` folder for tracked data.
   - **Integration**: GitHub Actions can sync data between Supabase Postgres and the `/data/` directory.

### GitHub Actions Workflow:

- You can create a workflow in GitHub Actions to automate tasks such as syncing data between the `/data/` directory and Supabase Postgres, running the notebooks, and handling errors and notifications.

### Considerations:

- **Version Control**: Ensure that the `/data/` directory is included in version control, while the `/temp/` directory is excluded (e.g., via `.gitignore`).
- **Permissions and Access**: If running on a VM or other system, ensure proper permissions and access to the NAS, temporary storage, and tracked data directories.
- **Scheduling and Automation**: Consider how often and when the notebooks and workflows should run, and how they are triggered and coordinated.

### Summary:
This structure and workflow align with the tasks and notebooks you described, with clear separation of temporary and tracked data, and integration with Postgres and GitHub Actions. By organizing the code, data, and automation in this way, you create a modular and manageable process for video processing, frame extraction, metadata generation, and database synchronization.
